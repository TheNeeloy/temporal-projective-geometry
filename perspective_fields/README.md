## File Structure

Look inside each sub-folder to see how to run that part of the project.
```
./
│   README.md - This file
└───projective_geometry - Folder with code to run perspective fields-based hallucination classifier
│   
└───perspective_fields_predictor - Folder with code to extract perspective fields
```

## Recommended Order of Running Project
1. Follow directions in `./perspective_fields_predictor` to predict fields
2. Follow directions in `./projective_geometry` to predict anomaly scores
