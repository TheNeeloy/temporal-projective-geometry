## File Structure

Look inside each sub-folder to see how to run that part of the project.
```
./
│   README.md - This file
└───projective-geometry - Folder with code to run object-shadow-based hallucination classifier
│   
└───ssis_predictor - Folder with code to extract object-shadow masks
```

## Recommended Order of Running Project
1. Follow directions in `./ssis_predictor` to predict masks
2. Follow directions in `./projective-geometry` to predict anomaly scores
