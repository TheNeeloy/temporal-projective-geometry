## File Structure

Look inside each sub-folder to see how to run that part of the project.
```
./
│   README.md - This file
└───projective_geometry - Folder with code to run line-segment-based hallucination classifier
│   
└───deep_lsd_predictor - Folder with code to extract line segments
```

## Recommended Order of Running Project
1. Follow directions in `./deep_lsd_predictor` to predict lines
2. Follow directions in `./projective_geometry` to predict anomaly scores
